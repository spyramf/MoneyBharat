Liquid funds are the most preferred due to their stable nature, while ELSS funds may have restrictions due to the lock-in period."},{question:"How much loan can I get against my mutual funds?",answer:"Most lenders offer 60-80% of the current value of your mutual fund portfolio. The exact percentage depends on the type of mutual funds - with debt funds typically getting higher LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios compared to equity funds."},{question:"Is there any impact on my mutual fund investment when I take a loan against it?",answer:"Your mutual funds remain invested and continue to earn returns. However, you cannot redeem, sell, or transfer the pledged units until you repay the loan.
