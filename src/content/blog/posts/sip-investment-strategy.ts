    <h2>Understanding SIP: The Foundation of Systematic Wealth Building</h2>
    <p>Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is one of the most powerful tools for wealth creation in India. By investing a fixed amount regularly, you can harness the power of compounding and rupee cost averaging.</p>
    
    <h2>Why SIP Works: The Science Behind Success</h2>
    <p>SIP success is based on three fundamental principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> Reduces impact of market volatility</li>
      <li><strong>Power of Compounding:</strong> Your returns generate their own returns</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> Removes emotional decision-making</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>SIP Strategy Framework for 2024</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Goal-Based SIP Planning</h3>
    <p>Align your SIPs with specific financial goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Child's education: 15-20 year horizon</li>
      <li>Retirement planning: 25-30 year horizon</li>
      <li>Home purchase: 5-10 year horizon</li>
      <li>Emergency fund: 1-2 year horizon</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Optimal SIP Amount Calculation</h3>
    <p>Follow the 50-30-20 rule:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>50% for needs (rent, groceries, utilities)</li>
      <li>30% for wants (entertainment, dining)</li>
      <li>20% for investments (including SIP)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Fund Selection Criteria</h3>
    <p>Choose funds based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent performance over 3-5 years</li>
      <li>Low expense ratios</li>
      <li>Experienced fund managers</li>
      <li>AUM size and liquidity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advanced SIP Strategies</h2>
    
    <h3>Step-Up SIP</h3>
    <p>Increase your SIP amount annually by 10-15% to match salary increments and beat inflation.</p>
    
    <h3>Top-Up SIP</h3>
    <p>Add lump sum investments during market downturns to maximize returns.</p>
    
    <h3>Multi-Cap SIP Portfolio</h3>
    <p>Distribute investments across:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Large Cap: 40% (stability)</li>
      <li>Mid Cap: 35% (growth)</li>
      <li>Small Cap: 25% (high growth potential)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Common SIP Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stopping SIP during market downturns</li>
      <li>Starting too many SIPs without clear goals</li>
      <li>Ignoring fund performance reviews</li>
      <li>Not increasing SIP amounts over time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
